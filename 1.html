<h2>Travel story - 나의 여행 이야기</h2>
<br>I've just come back from a trip to Portugal, Risbon Actually.It is a bit of <strong>a <u>last-minuite</u> decision.</strong>
My friend was attending a conference there and she convinced me to tag along.</br>
<br>I don't usually make <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/" target="_blank" title="my travel story">spontaneous decisions</a> But it all happened at right time.
At a news conference, President López Obrador said the investigation, to be carried out by federal and Mexico City prosecutors, should be done quickly. "We cannot get into speculation, much less blame the possible perpetrators without having proof," he said. The line was built when Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, a close ally of the president, was mayor of the capital. Speaking alongside the president, Mr Ebrard said it was a "very sad day for everyone". Current Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum also said it was too soon to say who was responsible for what happened. </p><p style="margin-top:45px;">Earlier, she said it appeared a girder had given way on the overpass. The line will remain closed while a structural survey is carried out CCTV footage showed the overpass collapsing as a train was travelling over it, sending up clouds of debris and sparks. The crash happened near the Olivos station, in the south-east of the city, on Monday night. Fernando Espino, secretary-general of the union representing metro workers, said the incident was related to a construction problem. "This is a structural failure... We don't know if it's related to the material with which this [section] was built. We need to see what happened," he said, according to El Universal newspaper. Elevated parts of the line, including the collapsed overpass, had to be closed for multiple repairs in 2014. Residents also reported cracks in the structure after an earthquake in 2017, and transport authorities made repairs following the reports. In 2017, the then director of the city's metro, Jorge Gaviño, said the line "was born with endemic problems that would never be solved in its life" and that it would require "permanent" maintenance.
